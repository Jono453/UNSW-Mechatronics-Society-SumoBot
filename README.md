# UNSW-Mechatronics-Society-SumoBot
Team project to build an autonomous robot to compete in a sumo wrestling tournament.
The robot chassis and necessary hardware/software was designed from scratch and created in a makerspace. 
This robot featured an Arduino microcontroller and possessed IR sensors and ultrasonic sensors to detect opponents and the ring.
A motorized lever arm was created with a servo motor and laser-cut wood.
